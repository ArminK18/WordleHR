# Wordle

This is a simple game based on a game known as [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). The game gives you a random 5-letter word from a predefined list of words. Your task is simple -- guess the word! 
You get clues as you are guessing the word such as letters colored in green (correct letter at a correct position) and letters colored in yellow (correct letter at a wrong position).
